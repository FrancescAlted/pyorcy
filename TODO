- Compile only when the function is requested (so that the pure python
  development cycle does not get an annoying compilation step).
- Add a setup.py install.
- Add unit tests.
- Replace the clean script by setup.py clean.
- find a cleaner import mechanism (in particular without the "if 'pyximport'")

hesitations
- Should we use lower case constants instead (USE_CYTHON, COMPILE, etc)?
- Try to put the .pyx file together with the built files in ~/.pyxbld?
